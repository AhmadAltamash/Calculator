## File Structure

- index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the calculator.
- calculator.css: The CSS file for styling the calculator.
- calculator.js: The JavaScript file containing the functionality for the calculator.

## Code Overview

### HTML

The HTML structure includes a container for the calculator, a screen to display the input and output, and buttons for each digit, operator, and special function.

### CSS

The CSS file styles the calculator with a neumorphic design. It includes styles for the light and dark modes and a custom switch for toggling between these modes.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file contains functions for handling button clicks, performing calculations, and managing the state of the calculator. It also includes an event listener for keyboard input and a function for toggling dark mode.

## Dark Mode Implementation

The dark mode is toggled by a switch element. When the switch is checked, the background color and button colors change to dark mode styles.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced mathematical operations.
- Add animations to button clicks and mode changes.
- Improve responsiveness for different screen sizes.
